This directory contains a test that I wrote while debugging issues
with axis binding.  It will not work as is, because I wrote it to
depend on some extra attributes/methods (renderTime attribute,
renderDoneFunc method, ...)  that I temporarily added to the
core.Multigraph model.  I'm committing it to the source repository,
though, in case it proves useful later as an example of a way
to do tests.
