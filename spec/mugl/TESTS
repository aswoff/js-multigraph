###
###  This file contains a list of mugl files from this directory, and
###  sizes (width followed by height) that they should be displayed
###  at.  The 'ant graphicstests' target will create a test html file
###  for viewing each of these mugl files at the specified size(s).
###
###  'ant graphicstests' also scans this directory to see what
###  mugl files are present in it, and creates a test html file at the
###  default size of 800 x 500 for any mugl files not listed here.  If
###  a mugl file is listed here, no default is created -- only the
###  sizes mentioned here will be generated.
