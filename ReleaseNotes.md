Version 3.90 (2012-04-03)
-------------------------

* This is a test release whose purpose is just to make sure that the release
  build/deploy process is working properly.  It's a real release, in the sense
  that you can download and use it, and it has these real release notes, but
  it's not intended for widespread use.
